This is a general comment I received from the people that quickly reviewed it. I\u2019m not familiar with RFC9130 so here is a first round of comments.\r\no\tFrom a quick scan RFC 9130 has the protocol level module (isis) with a part covering the interfaces, while we split the parameters into node level and termination point level. Maybe the comment is referring to the mapping between these things? Since we\u2019re augmenting the network model we off course need to speak about node and termination point, but maybe we can add a mapping? The termination point equals the interface in IS IS right? \r\no\tTimer attributes: we have LSP lifetime and LSP refresh interval. In RFC9130 LSP lifetime seems to be consistent, while the LSP refresh interval seems to be simply lsp-refresh \r\n\r\n  feature lsp-refresh {\r\n       description\r\n         \"Configuration of the LSP refresh interval.\";\r\n     }\r\n\r\no\tWe use level, but if I correctly understood it maps against \u201clevel-type\u201d in RFC 9130?\r\no\tNeighbours: we use IP address but in RFC9130 they seem to be identified via system ID\r\n \r\no\tRegarding the interfaces (isis-termination-point-attributes)we have the following mapping: \r\n\uf0a7\t       +--rw interface-type?   Identityref     \uf0e0 OK\r\n\uf0a7\t       +--rw level?            ietf-isis:level    \uf0e0 this should be level-type?\r\n\uf0a7\t       +--rw metric?           uint64 \uf0e0 this should have 3 value: value, level-1 and level-2 rigth?\r\n\uf0a7\t       +--rw is-passive?       Boolean \uf0e0 just passive, no is.\r\n",
