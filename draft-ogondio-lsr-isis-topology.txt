Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
   view of the provider network topology that contains Intermediate
   System to Intermediate System (ISIS) information.  This document
   augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding ISIS concepts.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Topology collection is a critical use case for the network operators
   because the network topology is an abstract representation of the
   physical nodes, links and network interconnections.  Network planning
   processes requires that the network resources are placed to meet the
   traffic demands requirements not just in terms of bandwidth or delay,
   but also for failure scenarios.  Network operators does the network
   planning process as an offline process, which obtains the information
   not directly from the network, but from inventory or template
   information.  The main reason for this process was that there was a
   lack of a dynamic and programmatic interfaces that can allow the
   planning tools to obtain such information.

   Thanks to the definition of the ietf-network model in [RFC8345] this
   situation has changed, because network operators can use an API with
   dynamic topological information.  On top of the work in [RFC8345],
   [RFC8346] and [RFC8944] extends the generic network and network
   topology data models with topology attributes that are specific to
   Layer 3 and Layer 2.  However, there is not any model that exposes
   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (ISIS) information.  This
   information is required in the IP/MPLS planning process to properly
   assess the required network resources to meet the traffic demands in
   normal and failure scenarios.

   The main objective of this model is to represent most relevant ISIS
   topology attributes.

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing, managing
   and controlling the ISIS topology.  The data model augments ietf-
   network module [RFC8345] by adding the ISIS information.

   This document explains the scope and purpose of the ISIS topology
   model and how the topology and service models fit together.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC8345].  The document uses terms from those documents.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950], [RFC8795] and [RFC8346].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Tree Diagram

   Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data
   model is used in Section 3 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.4.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

              +========+=======================+===========+
              | Prefix | Yang Module           | Reference |
              +========+=======================+===========+

2.  YANG Data Model for ISIS Topology

   The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-
   network" module of [RFC8345].  The ISIS-topology builds on the
   network data model defined in the "ietf-network" module [RFC8345],
   augmenting the nodes with ISIS information, which anchor the links
   and are contained in nodes).

   There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at
   the node level.  Each parameter and description are detailed
   following:

   *  Network-types: Its presence identifies the ISIS topology type.
      Thus, the network type MUST be isis-topology.

   *  ISIS timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes
      configured in the network element.  They are LSP lifetime and the
      LSP refresh interval.

   *  ISIS status: contains the ISIS status attributes (level, area-
      address and neighbours).

   There is a second set of parameters and augmentations are included at
   the termination point level.  Each parameter is listed as follows:

   *  Interface-type

   *  Level

   *  Metric

   *  Passive mode

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-isis-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-l3-isis-topology
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-isis-topology
   maintained by IANA: N
   prefix:       ietf-l3-isis-topology
   reference:    RFC XXXX

7.  Implementation Status

   This section will be used to track the status of the implementations
   of the model.  It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes
   RFC.
